                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I'm an undergraduate (Junior) at the Johns Hopkins University majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics, graduating May 2026. I'm interested in data science, quantitative analysis and software engineering, and I'm interested in working more in those areas.

                    <br> <br>

                    I currently work under the Carey Business School as a marketing data analyst. I am looking for 2025 summer opportunities as well as full-time jobs in 2026 or 2027 in software engineering, data analysis, and other related fields.

                    <br> <br>

                    In my free time, I enjoy dancing with JHU Eclectics (Technical Operations Chair), different crews and taking dance classes around the world, playing violin with the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra, and swimming with the JHU Club Swim Team. I also work for JHU Undergraduate Admissions, giving tours and panels, and work part-time at the Starbucks Coffee Company.

                    <br> <br>
